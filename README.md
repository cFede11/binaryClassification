This project comprises binary classification code written in Python. The datasets can be entirely customized by modifying the 'test' and 'train' subfolders to suit your preferences.

Instructions:

1 - Run main.py to generate a learning model .h5 file using the datasets located in the 'imageset/train' directory.

2 - Run tester.py to assess the model created in step 1. This will utilize the test images found within the 'imageset/test' directory and generate a new folder named 'results' containing the evaluated images, along with a CSV file summarizing the evaluation results.
